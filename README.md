Rathnam: A Formulaic Action Drama That Fails to Shine
"Rathnam" (Gem), a 2024 Tamil-language action drama, marks the third collaboration between director Hari and actor Vishal. The film, produced by Stone Bench Films, Zee Studios, and Invenio Origin, attempts to recapture the magic of their previous collaborations, "Thaamirabharani" and "Poojai," but ultimately falls short, delivering a predictable and formulaic narrative that lacks the spark and originality of their earlier works.

"Rathnam" - A Protector's Quest for Justice: Exploring the Plot and Characters:

Rathnam, a loyal henchman working for MLA Panneer Selvam in Vellore, finds himself drawn into a conflict when he witnesses the harassment of Malliga, a medical student who bears a striking resemblance to his late mother, Loganayagi. The perpetrators, Beema Rayudu and his brothers, are ruthless land grabbers seeking to acquire Malliga's family's property.

Driven by a sense of duty and a protective instinct towards Malliga, Rathnam intervenes, thwarting the Rayudu brothers' attempts to intimidate her. As he delves deeper into the conflict, Rathnam uncovers a dark secret from his past, revealing a connection between his family and the Rayudu brothers that dates back generations.

The film's narrative unfolds as a series of violent confrontations and revelations, as Rathnam seeks justice for his family's past wrongs and protects Malliga from the Rayudu brothers' relentless pursuit.

Vishal's Familiar Action Hero Persona:

Vishal reprises his familiar action hero persona as Rathnam, delivering a performance that is both physically imposing and emotionally charged. However, the character lacks the depth and complexity that could have elevated the film beyond its formulaic narrative.

A Supporting Cast That Struggles to Shine:

The film features a talented supporting cast, including Priya Bhavani Shankar as Malliga and Loganayagi, Samuthirakani as MLA Panneer Selvam, and Murali Sharma as the menacing Beema Rayudu. However, their characters are largely underdeveloped, serving primarily as plot devices rather than fully realized individuals.

Is "Rathnam" a Real Story?

"Rathnam" is a fictional narrative that draws inspiration from the conventions of the action drama genre. While the film's portrayal of land grabbing, political corruption, and the cycle of violence may reflect real-world issues, its characters and events are not based on any specific true story.

Is "Rathnam" a Hit or Flop?

"Rathnam" received mixed reviews from critics and achieved moderate success at the box office, making it an average grosser. While the film's action sequences and Vishal's performance were praised, its predictable plot and lack of originality hindered its overall impact.

A Deeper Dive into the Themes of "Rathnam":

Despite its formulaic approach, "Rathnam" attempts to explore several themes:

Justice and Revenge: The film's central conflict revolves around Rathnam's quest for justice for his family's past wrongs and his pursuit of revenge against the Rayudu brothers. However, the film's exploration of these themes lacks nuance and depth.

The Cycle of Violence: Rathnam's journey highlights the cyclical nature of violence, as his actions perpetuate a chain of bloodshed and suffering. The film fails to offer a compelling commentary on this theme, opting instead for a simplistic portrayal of revenge.

Family Loyalty and Honor: Rathnam's unwavering loyalty to his family and his commitment to upholding their honor drive his actions throughout the film. However, the film's portrayal of these themes feels clichéd and lacks emotional resonance.

The Power of Fate and Destiny: The film's narrative suggests that Rathnam's destiny is intertwined with his family's past, leading him down a path of violence and retribution. However, the film's exploration of fate and destiny feels underdeveloped and lacks a sense of inevitability.

Conclusion: "Rathnam" - A Formulaic Action Drama That Fails to Leave a Lasting Impression

"Rathnam" is a formulaic action drama that relies heavily on familiar tropes and lacks the originality and depth to stand out in the crowded landscape of Tamil cinema. While Vishal's performance is commendable and the film's action sequences are competently executed, "Rathnam" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to create a truly engaging and memorable cinematic experience. The film's predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lack of thematic depth leave audiences with a sense of déjà vu, a feeling that they've seen this story play out countless times before.


Is ‘Rathnam’ Streaming?

No, Rathnam is not yet available to stream. Rathnam will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If Rathnam arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.

Is ‘Rathnam’ In Theaters?

Absolutely! Audiences can catch Rathnam in theaters starting June 14, 2024 - right during the Father’s Day frame. According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first movie.

Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror flick The Watchers premiered on June 7. Previously, the film was pushed back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as Rathnam. However, The Watchers eventually returned to its initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s directorial debut, The Watchers follows a 28-year-old Mina (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.

Also coming in hot this June is Rathnam, which also premiered on June 7, 2024. Serving as the franchise’s fourth installment since its previous release in 2020, Rathnam reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as they work outside the system to investigate corruption within the Miami Police Department and get their hands dirty to prove their innocence.
